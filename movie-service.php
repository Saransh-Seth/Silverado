    "description":["'Nanak Shah Fakir', is a meditation of each waking day which began as a dream I saw one particular night. Ever since then, almost each day of being on the sets has been a journey worth preserving in the vaults of memory. The extraordinary experiences have left us all overwhelmed and deeply humbled. While some have been recorded on reel, others are embedded in the heart, forever. In one way, just calling out the name of the film (which would be numerous times in the day) felt as if the rosary beads were being rolled on the fingertips by the soul within. The film couldn't have been made without the Almighty's blessings. Nanak Shah Fakir is based on the life and teachings of Guru Nanak who Born in 1469 A.D. Nanak traveled the world to spread the essence of 'Ik Onkar' (there's but One God) as a philosophy and way of life. A philosophy that has survived and risen above the flux of conflict and time, impacting over 50 million followers worldwide and giving birth to 'SIKHISM' as a way of life. ('Sikh' signifies a disciple). "],

      "Seasoned con-man Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) goes to a nightclub, where a very inexperienced grifter, Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie), attempts to seduce him by pretending that they've been caught by her jealous husband, in order to con Nicky. Seeing through their deception, Nicky exposes their plan and advises them never to lose focus when faced with unexpected situations before leaving. Jess finds him in another nightclub a few days later and convinces Nicky to become her mentor by detailing all information she acquired on him, including that his father, Bucky Spurgeon, was forced to shoot Nicky's grandfather after a con gone wrong, a ploy known as the \"Toledo Panic Button.\". Nick takes Jess to New Orleans, where she is introduced to Nicky's crew. She picks a few pockets a test, and soon Nicky and Jess develop a romantic relationship, upsetting Nicky, who was taught by his father to never become emotionally involved with anyone in their line of business. At the 17th Associated Football Franchise of America Championship Game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome between the Chicago Rhinos and the Miami Threshers, Nicky and Jess con a compulsive gambler, Liyuan Tse (B.D. Wong) out of all his money, after making Tse pick a player's number, 55, from the game---a number that he was psychologically programmed by Nicky and his crew to pick which would be the same number worn on the Chicago sideline by a person Jess would easily recognize: Farhad (Adrian Martinez), a member of the crew. Nicky later explains that Jess was the \"little blind mouse\" who was not supposed to know until later that Nicky was running a game on Tse the whole time. Afterwards, Nicky gives Jess her share but reluctantly sends her away, leaving her heartbroken."
